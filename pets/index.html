                    I first met him when he was four-month-old in 2017. Because my friends used to call me Daisy, so I named him after one of Donald Duck's nephews.

                    I adopted him on my birthday when I was in Iowa in 2018. 
                    He was in the adoption center of a Petco store and I was dropping by to grab some food for my dog. 
                    Our encounter is like destiny and I fell in love with him at the first sight.
